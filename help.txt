Usage:
RastaConverter.exe InputFile [options]

To save the output during the optimization process press 's' key.
To save the output with dithering press 'd'. The set the dithering strength use '+' and '-' keys.

Copy created output files to the Generator directory and run 'build.bat' to create executable file.

The application displays three images:
- the left one is the original picture resized to Atari width.
- the right one is the original picture mapped to choosen Atari palette. This is our goal to reach.
- the cental one is preview of the output picture.

If the colors on the right image are wrong (f.e. too gray) then try some different palette file
or remap original picture to choosen palette file using other tool f.e. Timanthes.
Below on the screen are some statistics from the optimization process.
With the current algorithm the longer you wait, the better results you get. 
For some pictures more than 1 million of evaluations is needed to get really good results.

Command line options:

/i=Input File
  File to process. All the formats of the FreeImage library supported, including JPG, PNG, GIF and BMP.

/h=Output Height
  Default: 240.
  Generated file height. The speed of the optimization process depends on the height. 

/pal=Palette File
  Default: Palettes\altirra.act
  The output quality depends a lot on similarity between chosen Atari palette and the image palette.
  The default palette covers a large color range and is close to real Atari palette.
  Converting GFX from C64 it is usually better to use: /pal=Palettes\laoo.act     
  You can also use shorcuts: /pal=laoo and the converter will try to load palette from 'Palettes\laoo.act'

/noborder
  This option allows RastaConverter to use one more sprite that covers overscan borders. 
  While output picture is better there are "random" horizontal lines on the both sides of the picture.

/filter=Resize filter
  Default: lanczos, other recommended: box  
  Filter used to resize the picture to the Atari width=160 color pixels (40 bytes). 
  For most of the pictures the default filter is the best, but converting pictures from C64
  /filter=box is recommended - it preserves details better.
	Possible filters are: lanczos, box, bicubic, bilinear, bspline, catmullrom

/init=Initial optimization state
   Default: smart
   The optimization search space is large and the final results depends a lot on the initial values.
   You may see that RastaConverter sometimes optimizes not those details of the picture that you want.
   To change the initial value you may use other states: random, empty   

/o=Output File
  Output file name. The default name is 'output.png'. 
  Using a different name you have to change the file names used in the Generator.
  
/s=Number of solutions
  You may set a different number of solutions used in the optimization process.
  With /s=1 (default) the optimization algorithm is heuristic Hill Climbing.
  With more solutions the Tabu Search algorithm is used. It may produce a better picture, 
  but it is usually better/faster to run the Hill Climbing a few times.
  
Example:
RastaConverter.exe c64.png /filter=box /h=200 /pal=palettes\laoo.act
